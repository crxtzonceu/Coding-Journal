  ## Thoughts and What i did
  - I start again from html to remember the things that i've learned a long ago. it is so hard to be back at programming since whenever i started studying i immediately feel sleepy and exhausted and it is maybe the result of me taking a break and have no motivation to study.

  - I still remember a lot of things but i feel i do really need to review all of those things from the start and im willing to learn web 
  development again even though i still don't know what programming field/career should i focus on.

  #### What i learned/review
  ### HTML
  * <DOCTYPE html>  = what version of HTML is being used
  * <html></html>   = root element of the document
  * <head></head>   = the info's or data that is about the document and is not seen by the user's
  * <body></body>   = contains all the documents data that is seen by the user
  * <title></title> = the title or name that is shown on the webpage tab bar
  * <h1>,<h2>,<h3>,<h4>,<h5>,<h6>  = headings of the html
</details>
