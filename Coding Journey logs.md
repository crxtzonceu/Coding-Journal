  ## Thoughts and What i did
  - I start again from html to remember the things that i've learned a long ago. it is so hard to be back at programming since whenever i started studying i immediately feel sleepy and exhausted and it is maybe the result of me taking a break and have no motivation to study.

  - I still remember a lot of things but i feel i do really need to review all of those things from the start and im willing to learn web 
  development again even though i still don't know what programming field/career should i focus on.

  #### What i learned/review
  ### HTML
  * ```html<DOCTYPE html>```  = what version of HTML is being used.
  * ```html<html></html>```   = root element of the document.
  * ```html<head></head>```   = the info's or data that is about the document and is not seen by the user's.
